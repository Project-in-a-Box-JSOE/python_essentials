Challenge 9: Push web crawler project to GitHub

Step 1, on your GitHub, select “New repository”. Enter your favorite repo name such as “web_crawler”. Then click “create repository”. Copy the SSH url of the newly created repo. 
Step 2, open Git Bash and use “ls” and “cd” commands to reach inside the folder where your web crawler project is located. For example, you saved your projects in a folder on desktop called “web_crawler”. Then write the following to go inside the project folder. 
$ cd web_crawler/
Now your directory is something like ~/Desktop/web_crawler. 

Step 3, we initialize the project folder as a Git repo by “git init”: 
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in C:/Users/Changtai Liu/Desktop/web_crawler/.git/

Step 4, we add all the files in that directory to Git repo: 
$ git add -A
“-A” simply means to add all files. 

Step 5, do not forget to commit your changes. 
$ git commit -m "My web crawler project"
[master (root-commit) ba4d051] My web crawler project
 XX files changed, XXXX insertions(+)

Step 6, link our local repo to remote repo on GitHub. 
$ git remote add origin <YOUR REPO URL>
Your repo url is the link you copied in step 1. 

Step 7, push the entire repo to Git remote repo. 
$ git push -u origin master

Finally, refresh GitHub website and you will see your web crawler project. You are all set.
